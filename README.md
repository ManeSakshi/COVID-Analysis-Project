1) Overview

The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project allows users to:

    Analyze global and country-specific COVID-19 trends.
    Visualize total cases, deaths, and trends using static and interactive plots.
    Gain insights through bar plots, line charts, and computed statistics.

2) Features

    Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed COVID-19 data for analysis.
    Visualizations:
        Global trends of total COVID-19 cases over time.
        Top 10 countries by total cases displayed in both bar charts and interactive plots.
    Interactivity: Interactive charts built with Plotly for enhanced exploration.
    Statistical Insights: Case Fatality Ratios (CFR) computed and analyzed.

3) Setup Instructions

    a.Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ManeSakshi/COVID-Analysis-Project.git
    cd COVID-Analysis-Project

    b.Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    c.Run the Code: Open the COVID_Analysis.ipynb file in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.

4) Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset, which is updated regularly with detailed statistics on cases and deaths globally.

5) Usage

    a.Global Trends Analysis:
        View how COVID-19 cases have grown over time globally.
        Examine trends for weekly and biweekly case changes.

    b.Country-Specific Analysis:
        Identify the top 10 countries with the highest total cases.
        Analyze and compare country-specific data interactively.

    c.Visualizations:
        Static plots generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
        Interactive plots for deeper exploration using Plotly.

6) Visualizations

    a.Line Chart: Shows global COVID-19 case trends over time.
    b.Bar Chart: Compares total cases among the top 10 affected countries.
    c.Interactive Plots: Explore data dynamically with hover and zoom features.
